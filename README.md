# Kaōzeth

## About

This is a game, I think!

> **Note:** This project uses [Zeta Framework](https://github.com/harrisonkwhite/zeta_framework), a simple framework I made for developing 2D games using OpenGL.

---

## Building

Building and running this project has only been tested on Windows.

Clone the repository by running `git clone --recursive https://github.com/harrisonkwhite/kaozeth.git`.

> **Note:** If the repository was cloned non-recursively before, just run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to clone the necessary submodules.

Then go into the repository root and build with CMake:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```
