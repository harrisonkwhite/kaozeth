# Terraria Clone in C

This project began as an original game, but I eventually realised it would be more productive to just clone an existing game so I could focus solely on programming technique and not have to worry about game design.

I chose Terraria because it is composed of so many different systems (e.g. world generation, lighting, liquid simulation, NPC AI, networking).

This is a personal project created to improve my programming skills.

The project uses a Raylib-esque framework I built called [Zeta Framework](https://github.com/yourusername/zeta-framework), also developed for learning purposes.
