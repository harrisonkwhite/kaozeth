# Terraria Clone in C

This is a personal project I am developing to improve my programming skills.

It began as an original game, but I eventually realised it would be more productive to just clone an existing one so I could focus solely on programming technique and not have to worry about game design.

I chose to clone Terraria specifically because it is composed of so many different interesting systems (e.g. world generation, lighting, liquid simulation, NPC AI, networking).

This project uses [Zeta Framework](https://github.com/harrisonkwhite/zeta_framework), a simple framework I made for developing 2D games using OpenGL.
