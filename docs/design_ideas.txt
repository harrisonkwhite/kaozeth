So the core idea of you being in this open, nightmarish desert realm is quite appealing.
And the idea 

Games that come up as references include:
- Necesse (totally flat open world, similar 2D perspective)
- ZERO Sievert (flat open world but more complex than Necesse, similar 2D perspective)
- Sand: A Superfluous Game

There's also Breath of the Wild, which is more complex but has a similar open structure where you have a somewhat barren world populated with occassional landmarks.

But the thing with BoTW is that the 3D perspective allows for easier navigation since you can see landmarks from afar.

Here are some braindump ideas:
- You are being followed by some dark demonic deathly entity. It might manifest in various ways. The goal of the game is survive for as long as possible against it. This is a nice analog if the world is to have temporary spots.
- The game could basically be action survival. Think of a more minimal Fallout, or a Blood Meridian kind of landscape navigation.

Well let's imagine you spawn in this desert world. What do you do?

Well in Necesse for example, you've got the external threat of night that compels you to start gathering resources and powering up.

This game could really be about escaping death. That's what drives you and directs you.
